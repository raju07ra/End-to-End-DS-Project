# Demand-Driven Inventory Forecasting for Retail Optimization

## 1. Project Overview

This end-to-end data science project addresses a critical challenge in the retail industry: **inventory optimization**. By leveraging historical sales data, this solution builds a robust machine learning model to accurately forecast future product demand for the Rossmann chain of drug stores.

The primary goal is to provide store managers with a reliable forecasting tool to minimize the financial risks associated with overstocking (carrying costs, waste) and understocking (lost sales, poor customer satisfaction). The project follows the CRISP-DM framework, covering the entire data science lifecycle from data acquisition and cleaning to model evaluation and interpretation.

## 2. Business Problem & Value

*   **Problem:** Retail chains frequently struggle with inefficient inventory management, leading to significant revenue loss. Traditional forecasting methods are often too simplistic to capture complex demand patterns influenced by promotions, holidays, and seasonality.
*   **Solution:** This project implements a time-series regression model using LightGBM to predict daily sales for individual stores. By engineering features that capture temporal dynamics and store-specific characteristics, the model provides granular and accurate demand forecasts.
*   **Business Value:**
    *   **Reduce Stockouts:** Proactively identify high-demand periods to ensure product availability.
    *   **Minimize Overstock:** Avoid unnecessary inventory costs by forecasting low-demand periods.
    *   **Improve Operational Efficiency:** Automate the forecasting process, freeing up managers for other critical tasks.
    *   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Enable a shift from heuristic-based ordering to a strategic, data-informed replenishment strategy.

## 4. How to Run This Project

To set up and run this project locally, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raju07ra/retail-forecasting.git
cd retail-forecasting

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Bash
# Step 4: Download the Dataset
Download the Rossmann Store Sales dataset from Kaggle.
Place the train.csv and store.csv files inside the data/raw/ directory.

# Step 5: Run the Jupyter Notebooks
Execute the notebooks sequentially in the following order:
01-Data_Acquisition_and_Cleaning.ipynb: This will process the raw data and save a clean version in data/processed/.
02-Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb: This notebook performs visual analysis on the cleaned data.
03-Modeling_and_Evaluation.ipynb: This trains the model, evaluates its performance, and saves the final model artifact to the models/ directory.

Key drivers of sales identified by the model include store competition distance, promotion status, day of the week, and recent sales trends.
# 6. Future Work
SKU-Level Forecasting: Extend the model to predict demand for individual products, not just total store sales.
External Data Integration: Incorporate external factors like local weather forecasts and public holiday data to improve accuracy.
Deployment as an API: Wrap the model in a REST API using Flask or FastAPI for real-time integration with other business systems.
Interactive Dashboard: Build a Streamlit or Dash dashboard to allow non-technical users to interact with the forecasts.
